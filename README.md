# PonyVN
This repo will serve as main base for developments of the PonyVN.

All code will be stored in the "code" folder, *duh.* (Also - images, sounds and other assets)

All proposals and ideas are to be stored in the appropriate folders ("twilight" for working with Bookbutt's route, for example) in a general "suggestions" folder.

For any questions please e-mail ponegame.anon@gmail.com or write in the thread.

Thank you for your cooperation! We'll get this done!
